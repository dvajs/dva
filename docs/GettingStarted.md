# Getting Started

> This article will lead you to create [dva](https://github.com/dvajs/dva) app quickly, and learn all new concepts.

Final App.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://zos.alipayobjects.com/rmsportal/iYdclktvqzUHGBe.gif" />
</p>

This app is used to test click speed, by collecting click count within 1 second.

Some questions you may ask.

1. How to create app?
2. How to organize code after created app?
3. How to build, deploy and publish after development?

And somethings about code organization.

1. How to write Component?
1. How to write CSS?
1. How to write Model?
1. How to connect Model and Component?
1. How to update State after user interaction?
1. How to handle async logic?
1. How to config router?

And.

1. If I want to use localStorage to save Highest Record, what to do?
2. If we want to support keyboard click rate test, what to do?

We can takes these questions to read this article. But don't worry, all the code we need is about 70 lines.

## Install dva-cli

dva-cli is the cli tool for dva, include `init`, `new`.

```bash
$ npm install -g dva-cli
```

After installed, you can check version with `dva -v`, and view help info with `dva -h`.

## Create new App

After installed dva-cli, we can create a new app with it, called `myapp`.

```bash
$ dva new myapp --demo
```

Notice: `--demo` option is only used for creating demo level app. If you want to create normal project, don't add this option.

`cd` myapp, and start it.

```bash
$ cd myapp
$ npm start
```

After a few seconds, you will get these outputs:

```bash
          proxy: listened on 8989
     livereload: listening on 35729
ðŸ“¦  173/173 build modules
webpack: bundle build is now finished.
```

(Press `Ctrl-C` if you want to close server)

Open http://localhost:8989/ in browser. If success, you will see a page with "Hello Dva".

## Define models

When get the task, you should not write code immediately. But recommend to do state design in `god mode`.

1. design models
2. design components
3. connect models and components

With this task, we define model in this:

```javascript
app.model({
  namespace: 'count',
  state: {
    record : 0,
    current: 0,
  },
});
```

`namespace` is the key where model state is in global state. `state` is the default data for model. Then record presents `highest record`ï¼Œand `current` presents current click speed.

## Write components

After designed model, we start to write component. Recommend to organize Component with [stateless functions](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#stateless-functions). Because we don't need state almost in dva architecture.

```javascript
import styles from './index.less';
const CountApp = ({count, dispatch}) => {
  return (
    <div className={styles.normal}>
      <div className={styles.record}>Highest Record: {count.record}</div>
      <div className={styles.current}>{count.current}</div>
      <div className={styles.button}>
        <button onClick={() => { dispatch({type: 'count/add'}); }}>+</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Notice:

1. `import styles from './index.less';`, and then use `styles.xxx` to define css classname is the solution of [css-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
2. passes in two propsï¼Œ`count` and `dispatch`. `count` is the state in model, bind with connect. And `dispatch` is used to trigger an action
3. `dispatch({type: 'count/add'})` means trigger an action `{type: 'count/add'}`. View [Actions@redux.js.org](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Actions.html) on what's an action.

## Update state

`reducer` is the only one which can update state, this make our app stable, all data modification is traceable. `reducer` is pure function, accept arguments `state` and `action`, return new `state`.

```javascript
(state, action) => newState
```

We need two reducers, `add` and `minus`. Please notice `add` will only be recorded if it's highest.

> Notice: `add` and `minus` don't need to add namespace prefix in `count` model. But if outside the model, action must prefix namespace separated with `/`. e.g. `count/add`.

```diff
app.model({
  namespace: 'count',
  state: {
    record: 0,
    current: 0,
  },
+ reducers: {
+   add(state) {
+     const newCurrent = state.current + 1;
+     return { ...state,
+       record: newCurrent > state.record ? newCurrent : state.record,
+       current: newCurrent,
+     };
+   },
+   minus(state) {
+     return { ...state, current: state.current - 1};
+   },
+ },
});
```

Notice:

1. Confused with `...` operator? It's used for extend Object, similar to `Object.extend`
2. `add(state) {}` is equal to `add: function(state) {}`

## Bind Data

> Remember `count` and `dispatch` props used in the Component before? Where are them come from?

After define Model and Component, we need to connect them together. After connect, Component can use the data from Model, and Model can receive actions dispatched from Component.

In this task, we only need to bind `count` .

```javascript
function mapStateToProps(state) {
  return { count: state.count };
}
const HomePage = connect(mapStateToProps)(CountApp);
```

Notice: `connect` is from [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#connectmapstatetoprops-mapdispatchtoprops-mergeprops-options)ã€‚

## Define Router

> Which Component should be rendered after receiving a url? It's defined by router.

This app has only one page, so we don't need to modify the router part.

```javascript
app.router(({history}) =>
  <Router history={history}>
    <Route path="/" component={HomePage} />
  </Router>
);
```

Notice:

1. `history` is default hashHistory with `_k` params. It can be changed to browserHistory, or remove `_k` params with extra configuration.

Refresh page in browser, if success, you will see page below.

</p>

## Add StyleSheet

We define stylesheet in `css modules`, which doesn't have many differences from normal css. Because we have already hooked className in Component, at this moment, we only need to replace `index.less` with follow content:

```css
.normal {
  width: 200px;
  margin: 100px auto;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  box-shadow: 0 0 20px #ccc;
}

.record {
  border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding-bottom: 8px;
  color: #ccc;
}

.current {
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 40px;
  padding: 40px 0;
}

.button {
  text-align: center;
  button {
    width: 100px;
    height: 40px;
    background: #aaa;
    color: #fff;
  }
}
```

Result.

</p>

## Async Logic

Prior to this, all of our operations are synchronous. When clicking on the + button, the value is incremented by 1.

Now we have to dealing with async logic. dva process side effect( async logic ) with effects on model, which is executed based on [redux-saga](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga), with generator syntax.

In this app, when user clicked the + button, value will plus 1, and trigger a side effect, that is, minus 1 after 1 second.

```diff
app.model({
  namespace: 'count',
+ effects: {
+   *add(action, { call, put }) {
+     yield call(delay, 1000);
+     yield put({ type: 'minus' });
+   },
+ },
...
+function delay(timeout){
+  return new Promise(resolve => {
+    setTimeout(resolve, timeout);
+  });
+}
```

Notice:

1. `*add() {}` is equal to `add: function*(){}`
2. `call` and `put` are effect commands from redux-saga. `call` is for async logic, and `put` is for dispatching actions. Besides, there are commands like `select`, `take`, `fork`, `cancel`, and so on. View more on [redux-saga documatation](http://yelouafi.github.io/redux-saga/docs/basics/DeclarativeEffects.html)

Refresh you browser, if success, it should have all the effects of beginning gif.

## Subscribe Keyboard Event

> After implemented mouse click speed test, how to implement keyboard click speed test?

There is a concept called `Subscription` from dva, which is from [elm 0.17](http://elm-lang.org/blog/farewell-to-frp).

Subscription is used for subscribe a data source, then dispatch action if needed. The data source could be current time, websocket connection from server, keyboard input, geolocation change, history router change, and so on.

Subscription is in model.

```diff
+import key from 'keymaster';
...
app.model({
  namespace: 'count',
+ subscriptions: {
+   keyboardWatcher({ dispatch }) {
+     key('âŒ˜+up, ctrl+up', () => { dispatch({type:'add'}) });
+   },
+ },
});
```

Here, we don't need to install `keymaster` dependency manually. When we write `import key from 'keymaster';` and save, dva-cli will install `keymaster` and save to `package.json`. Output like this:

```bash
use npm: tnpm
Installing `keymaster`...
[keymaster@*] installed at node_modules/.npminstall/keymaster/1.6.2/keymaster (1 packages, use 745ms, speed 24.06kB/s, json 2.98kB, tarball 15.08kB)
All packages installed (1 packages installed from npm registry, use 755ms, speed 23.93kB/s, json 1(2.98kB), tarball 15.08kB)
ðŸ“¦  2/2 build modules
webpack: bundle build is now finished.
```

## All Code Together

index.js

```javascript
import dva, { connect } from 'dva';
import { Router, Route } from 'dva/router';
import React from 'react';
import styles from './index.less';
import key from 'keymaster';

const app = dva();

app.model({
  namespace: 'count',
  state: {
    record: 0,
    current: 0,
  },
  reducers: {
    add(state) {
      const newCurrent = state.current + 1;
      return { ...state,
        record: newCurrent > state.record ? newCurrent : state.record,
        current: newCurrent,
      };
    },
    minus(state) {
      return { ...state, current: state.current - 1};
    },
  },
  effects: {
    *add(action, { call, put }) {
      yield call(delay, 1000);
      yield put({ type: 'minus' });
    },
  },
  subscriptions: {
    keyboardWatcher({ dispatch }) {
      key('âŒ˜+up, ctrl+up', () => { dispatch({type:'add'}) });
    },
  },
});

const CountApp = ({count, dispatch}) => {
  return (
    <div className={styles.normal}>
      <div className={styles.record}>Highest Record: {count.record}</div>
      <div className={styles.current}>{count.current}</div>
      <div className={styles.button}>
        <button onClick={() => { dispatch({type: 'count/add'}); }}>+</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

function mapStateToProps(state) {
  return { count: state.count };
}
const HomePage = connect(mapStateToProps)(CountApp);

app.router(({history}) =>
  <Router history={history}>
    <Route path="/" component={HomePage} />
  </Router>
);

app.start('#root');


// ---------
// Helpers

function delay(timeout){
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(resolve, timeout);
  });
}
```

## Build

Now that we've written our application and verified that it works in development, it's time to get it ready to deploy to our users. To do so, run the following command:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

Output.

```bash
> @ build /private/tmp/dva-quickstart
> atool-build

Child
    Time: 6891ms
        Asset       Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
    common.js    1.18 kB       0  [emitted]  common
     index.js     281 kB    1, 0  [emitted]  index
    index.css  353 bytes    1, 0  [emitted]  index
```

After build success, you can find compiled files in `dist` directory.

## What's Next

After complete this app, do you have answer of all the questions in the beginning? Do you understand this concepts in dva, like `model`, `router`, `reducers`, `effects` and `subscriptions` ?

Next, you can view [dva official library](https://github.com/dvajs/dva) for more information.
