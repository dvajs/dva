# Dva concept

## Data flow direction

Data changes usually occur through user interaction or browser behavior (such as route jumps). When such behavior changes data, an action can be initiated via `dispatch`. If it is synchronous, it will pass directly. `Reducers` change `State`, if it is asynchronous behavior (side effects) will trigger `Effects` and then flow to `Reducers` and finally change `State`, so in dva, the data flow is very clear and concise, and the idea is basically consistent with the open source community. (also from the open source community).

## Models

### State

`type State = any`

State represents the state data of the Model, usually represented as a javascript object (of course it can be any value); each time it is treated as immutable data, ensuring that each time it is a new object, no Quote relationships so that State independence is guaranteed, making it easy to test and track changes.

In dva you can see the top state data via the dva instance property `_store`, but usually you will rarely use it:

```javascript
const app = dva();
console.log(app._store); // State data at the top
```

### Action

`type AsyncAction = any`

Action is a plain javascript object that is the only way to change State. Whether it's data from a UI event, a network callback, or a data source such as WebSocket, the action is eventually called by the dispatch function, which changes the corresponding data. The action must have a `type` attribute to indicate the specific behavior. Other fields can be customized. If you want to initiate an action, you need to use the `dispatch` function. Note that `dispatch` is passed after props through the component connect models.
```
dispatch({
  type: 'add',
});
```

### dispatch function

`type dispatch = (a: Action) => Action`

The dispatching function is a function that triggers action, action is the only way to change State, but it only describes a behavior, and dipatch can be seen as the way to trigger this behavior, while Reducer describes how to change the data.

In dva, the components of the connect model can be accessed via props, and can be called Reducer or Effects in the Model. Common forms are:

```javascript
dispatch({
  type: 'user/add', // If you call outside the model, you need to add a namespace
  payload: {}, // Information to be passed
});
```

### Reducer

`type Reducer<S, A> = (state: S, action: A) => S`

The Reducer (also known as the reducing function) function takes two arguments: the result of the previously accumulated operation and the current value to be accumulated, and a new cumulative result is returned. This function groups a collection into a single value.

The concept of Reducer comes from functional programming, and there are reduce APIs in many languages. As in javascript:

```javascript
[{x:1},{y:2},{z:3}].reduce(function(prev, next){
    return Object.assign(prev, next);
})
//return {x:1, y:2, z:3}
```

In dva, the result of the aggregate accumulation of the reducers is the state object of the current model. The new value (that is, the new state) is obtained by evaluating the value passed in the actions with the value in the current reducers. Note that the Reducer must be [pure function](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide/blob/master/ch3.md), so the same input must get the same output, they should not Produce any side effects. Also, every time you calculate, you should use [immutable data](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide/blob/master/ch3.md#reasonable), which is a simple understanding of each operation. Both return a whole new amount of data (independent, pure), so hot overload and time travel can be used.

### Effect

Effect is called a side effect, and in our application, the most common is asynchronous operation. It comes from the concept of functional programming, which is called side effects because it makes our functions impure, and the same input does not necessarily get the same output.

In order to control the side-effect operation, dva introduces [redux-sagas](http://superraytin.github.io/redux-saga-in-chinese) for asynchronous process control, because of the [generator related concept](http ://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2015/04/generator.html), so asynchronously converted to synchronous writing, thus turning effects into pure functions. As for why we are so entangled in __pure function __, if you want to know more, you can read [Mostly adequate guide to FP](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide), or its Chinese Translation [JS Functional Programming Guide](https://www.gitbook.com/book/llh911001/mostly-adequate-guide-chinese/details).

### Subscription

Subscriptions is a way to get data from __source__, which comes from elm.

Subscription semantics is a subscription that is used to subscribe to a data source and then dispatch the required action based on the condition. The data source can be the current time, the server's websocket connection, keyboard input, geolocation changes, history routing changes, and more.

```javascript
import key from 'keymaster';
...
app.model({
  namespace: 'count',
  subscriptions: {
    keyEvent({dispatch}) {
      key('âŒ˜+up, ctrl+up', () => { dispatch({type:'add'}) });
    },
  }
});
```

## Router

The route here usually refers to the front-end routing. Since our application is usually a single-page application, we need front-end code to control the routing logic, provided by the browser [History API](http://mdn.beonex.com/ En/DOM/window.history.html) can listen to changes in the browser url to control routing related operations.

The dva instance provides the router method to control the route, using [react-router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router).

```javascript
import { Router, Route } from 'dva/router';
app.router(({history}) =>
  <Router history={history}>
    <Route path="/" component={HomePage} />
  </Router>
);
```

## Route Components

In [Component Design Method](https://github.com/dvajs/dva-docs/blob/master/v1/zh-cn/tutorial/04-%E7%BB%84%E4%BB%B6%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95.md), we mentioned Container Components, we usually constrain them to Route Components in dva, because in dva we Container Components are usually designed in page dimensions.

So in dva, the components that normally require the connect model are Route Components, organized in the `/routes/` directory, and the `/components/` directory is the pure components (Presentational Components).
