# Introduction

Dva is first a data flow scheme based on [redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) and [redux-saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga), then To simplify the development experience, dva also has built-in [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) and [fetch](https://github.com/github/fetch), so Can be understood as a lightweight application framework.

## Features

* ** Easy to learn and use**, only 6 apis, especially friendly to redux users, [use with umi](https://umijs.org/guide/with-dva.html) is reduced to 0 API
* **elm concept**, organize models via reducers, effects and subscriptions
* **Plug-in mechanism**, such as [dva-loading](https://github.com/dvajs/dva/tree/master/packages/dva-loading) can automatically handle the loading state without writing showLoading and hideLoading over and over again
* **Support HMR**, based on [babel-plugin-dva-hmr](https://github.com/dvajs/babel-plugin-dva-hmr) implement HMR for components, routes and models

## Origin of the name?

> D.Va’s mech is nimble and powerful — its twin Fusion Cannons blast away with autofire at short range, and she can use its Boosters to barrel over enemies and obstacles, or deflect attacks with her projectile-dismantling Defense Matrix.
